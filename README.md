## Projects

### C++ StringBuilder

![C++ StringBuilder](images/stringbuilder.png)

A simplified implementation of Java's StringBuilder class in C++. This project allows you to efficiently create and manipulate strings without the overhead of repeatedly creating new string objects. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) that lets you interact with instances of StringBuilders. With built-in functions like switching builders, inserting strings, appending integers, and more, you can easily create and modify strings to suit your needs.

### Undo/Redo Stack of Actions

Ever wished you could undo or redo your actions in a program? This project introduces an Undo/Redo stack implementation that allows you to manage a history of actions and navigate through them effortlessly. Whether you're working on a text editor, graphic design software, or any application where user actions need to be tracked, the Undo/Redo Stack of Actions project provides a solid foundation for implementing this essential feature.

### Cisco Packet Tracer Network Configuration
