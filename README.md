![C++ StringBuilder](images/stringBuilder0.png)

A simplified implementation of Java's StringBuilder class in C++. This project allows you to efficiently create and manipulate strings without the overhead of repeatedly creating new string objects. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) that lets you interact with instances of StringBuilders. With built-in functions like creating new builders, inserting strings, appending integers, and more, you can easily create and modify strings to suit your needs.

### [Undo/Redo Stack of Actions](URStack)
