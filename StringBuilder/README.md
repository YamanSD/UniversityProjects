MyStringBuilder Project

C++17 was used to fulfill the project.

Designed to mimic some of the functionality provided by StringBuilder class in Java.
The provided Google coding standards on Moodle were used.

Included is a simple Node class, & a MyStringBuilder class that mimics StringBuilder.

The Node class is designed to fit the needs of MyStringBuilder, as no specifications where given.

The MyStringBuilder class was designed according to the specifications with some changes to make implementing certain features in the class easier & more flexible.

As no limitations where proposed, liberty was taken in implementing the main.cpp logic.
Maps, colored displays, & a selection system for playing around with multiple MyStringBuilders were used.

The standard library saw very limited use in the implementation of MyStringBuilder, as to not defeat the point of the project.

Along the source files, you will find a compiled executable of the files.

Compilation was done using the GCC compiler:
	gcc (Rev2, Built by MSYS2 project) 12.1.0
